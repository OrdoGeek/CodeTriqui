# CodeTriqui
I created this project while studying a python course. It was a final task
This project the triqui play... have fun!

# INSTRUCTIONS
I was asked to programm the triki play. When the programm runs, will be displayed the triki table (matrix 3x3), and an input asking the user to chose the symbol "X" or "O". The first turn always is for the "X". The user must chose the position in the table (it has to be correct and can not be occupied) to put his/her symbol. The system validate if there is a winner or if there is a tie and continue asking for positions to put if there is not a winner or a tie. The programm finishes when there is a winner or a tie.
